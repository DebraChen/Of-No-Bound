50 years ago, the enhancement of virtual life enabled human beings to experience a complete social life without having to leaving home, but it brought the degeneration of their limbs to varying degrees gradually. Since it got worse, some people had been sent to sorting. ‘Of no bound’ project, adding Kinect and thumb manipulator to train the muscle flexibility of the player's thumb and arm. The empty personal space makes up for the lack of the real world, through the blue tone watercolor style scene, to adjust the player's nervousness, anxiety, and so on. Reorganizing the chaotic music helps to achieve spiritual healing. By improving physical and mental health, the project helps users to improve the success rate of screening before human-machine surgery.  


## BACKGROUND  
This project, simulating the research team in 2122, looked back on the virtual world revolution about 50 years ago, and made a rehabilitation design for the degeneration of human limbs after that, to arouse people's awareness of the current, real world.  
  
In contrast, the design team tries to provoke people's reflection about how the virtual world limits real-world activity by limiting the range of activities of the experiencer, and by attracting the player's attention while ignoring parts of the real-world experience. The game limits the physical user experience to 1 square meter space. The Kinect and thumb manipulators allow participants to control the game only through upper body activities and explore the open virtual world.  
  
The project ‘Of No Bound’ aims to express that there are many endless things, but the present moment is precious. In the era of excess information, 'Tittytainment' has occupied too much attention from people. On the way to pursuing a bigger goal, people also need to stop occasionally, pay attention to the second to experience the now, and also pay attention to the connection between the individual and the world. In the wave of fake news & propaganda, find the reef of independent thinking. ‘The grass is always greener on the other side, every moment that we are aware of and experiencing makes us who we are.
